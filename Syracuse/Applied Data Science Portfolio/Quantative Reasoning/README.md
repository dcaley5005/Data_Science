# IST 772 - Quantative Reasoning

Quantitative data analytics stands in the center of the field of data science. Yet most people who make use of analytical results – and a surprising number who produce those results – have little idea of how the nature of the data and the analysis impacts their interpretation. Uncertainty is an intrinsic and inescapable characteristic of data. If we fail to understand uncertainty when working with our data, at best we will make poorer decisions than necessary and at worst we will make catastrophic errors based on mistaken assumptions. Statistical inference is the process by which we make sense of uncertainty in data, and this course focuses on establishing a thoughtful and thorough understanding of statistical inference.
