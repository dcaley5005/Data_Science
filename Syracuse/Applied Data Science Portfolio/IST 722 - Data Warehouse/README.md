This course provides concepts, principles, and tools for designing, implementing, and using Data Warehouses. More specifically, we introduce database constructs such as Operational Data Store (ODS), Data Warehouse, and Data Mart, and related components. We study the differences between Ralf Kimballâ€™s and Bill Inmon's approaches, roles and responsibilities in the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse, project management guidelines and techniques, requirements gathering, dimensional modeling, Extract Transform and Load (ETL) architecture, analytical reporting concepts, data governance and recent trends in the data warehouse domain.
