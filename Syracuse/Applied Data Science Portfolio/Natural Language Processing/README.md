# IST 664 - Natural Language Processing

This course is designed to develop an understanding of how natural language processing (NLP) can process written text and produce a linguistic analysis that can be used in other applications. This goal will be achieved by:
- Demonstrate the levels of linguistic analysis, the computational techniques used to understand text at each level, and what the challenges are for those techniques.
- Process text through the language levels using the resources of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and some rudimentary use of the programming language Python.
- Describe how NLP is used in many types of real­ world applications.
- Corpus statistics and language modeling
- Regular expressions, morphology, and processing text files
- Part of speech (POS) tagging and introduction to machine learning (ML)
- Context­ free grammars and parsing
- Semantics & Sentiment analysis
- NLP applications: information extraction (IE), summarization, and machine translation (MT)
- NLP applications: information retrieval (IR), question answering (QA), and conversational agents
